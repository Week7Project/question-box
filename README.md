# QUESTION BOX

The question box app is meant to be a community site where users can ask
questions to the community, and allows other members to answer that question.
Answers then can be rated and the best answer will be the one with the most
votes.

Going to the website will prompt the user to login or register a new account
to the question box app.  The profile page will then show all of the questions
that the user has asked, providing a link to the question's detail page.  The
question detail page will include all of the answers for that question, as well
as an interface to vote on which answer is the most applicable.  

This app is meant to be an educational tool only and helped us practice
different layers of HTML/CSS/JS as well as giving us additional practice with
JSON and API requests, as well as introducing us to different ways of filtering
querysets.
